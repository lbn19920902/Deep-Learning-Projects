# CIFAR-10 Classification (Convolution 2D Neural Network)


The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. I used Convolutional neural network to classify each image into one of the 10 classes. 

The best accuracy is 76.67 in validation set.
